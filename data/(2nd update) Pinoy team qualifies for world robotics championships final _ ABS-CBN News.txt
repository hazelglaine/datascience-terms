Waialua High School won the Chairman's Award, while SIA Tech from San Jose, California won the Engineering Inspiration Award.The Philippine team, whose robot was named "Larry Labuyo," was also awarded the Highest Rookie Seed Award, which "celebrates the highest seeded rookie team at the conclusion of  the qualifying rounds."The Philippine team was registered as Team 3105 also known as “Philippine Team Lagablab.” Lagablab is the Filipino term for flame.Win shows Pinoys can do itTeam Lagablab official websitePSHS System websiteFIRST Hawaii competition siteTeam captain Catherine Angcangco said they are very thankful for all those who supported them during the competition, as well as those who prayed for their success.Dr. Ester Ogena, Director of the Department of Science and Technology-Science Education Institute (DOST-SEI), said that they are happy that the Filipino has once again proven their talent and skills in any science filed."We have found in Hawaii a treasure trove of talents and I am sure that there is more to tap in the Philippines," she said in a statement Tuesday.Ogena expressed jubilation over the Philippine team's triumph in the FRC Hawaii Regional which truly gave the country another morale booster."We have truly shown to the world that we can do it and we can make it big in international competitions, especially in robotics," she said.Ogena added that the Philippines is participating in the FRC to entice the students to venture into careers in robotics."We want our students to have the motivation and inspiration to become scientists and engineers by making them experience what it is like to be in the real world.

'Life-changing, career molding'FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is a US-based organization founded by inventor Dean Kamen in 1989, aimed at inspiring young people to engage in science and technology.This year’s challenge, “Lunacy”, is inspired by the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11."Just as NASA scientists landed a man on the moon and returned him safely to earth in 1969, so too will these young people go on and explore new frontiers and develop breakthrough technologies that change the world," Kamen was quoted as saying at the competiton's website, https://robotics.hawaii.gov/first.In the Lunacy game, robots are designed to pick up 9" game balls and score them in trailers hitched to their opponents’ robots for points during a 2 minute and 15 second match. Additional points are awarded for scoring a special game ball, the Super Cell, in the opponents' trailers during the last 20 seconds of the match. Lunacy is played on a low-friction floor, which means teams must contend with a surface designed to simulate driving on the moon.According to the website, the FIRST Robotics Competition is an exciting, multinational competition that teams professionals and young people to solve an engineering design problem in an intense and competitive way.Over 42,000 high-school-aged young people on over 1,686 teams participate in 41 regional events. In all, teams come from Brazil, Canada, Chile, Germany, Israel, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Turkey, the U.K. and every U.S. state. In the Hawaii round, teams from Hawaii, mainland US, Mexico, and the Philippines participated."The program is a life-changing, career-molding experience—and a lot of fun," it added.The 2009 FIRST Championship will be held at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, April 16-18.SharePorsche share price set at 82.5 euros for mega IPOSeptember 29, 2022Pinoy martial arts na arnis sumisikat sa The Netherlands September 29, 2022Hurricane Ian pounds Florida as monster Category 4 stormSeptember 29, 2022Presyo ng gulay mula sa mga binagyong lugar tumaasSeptember 29, 2022TINGNAN: Trak sumabit sa mga kable sa Katipunan Ave.September 29, 2022Apple removes Russian social network VK from app storeSeptember 29, 2022Tindahan ng medical supplies sa Maynila, nasunogSeptember 29, 2022James Bond's Aston Martin sells for nearly £3 millionSeptember 29, 2022“Ginto” exhibit, nagbukas sa IstanbulSeptember 29, 2022Maturity will be Cignal's advantage vs. Sta.
