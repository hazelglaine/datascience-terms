Gumagawa ako ng mga laruan. Noong ni-launch po yung (robotics) program sa school namin, nag-join po ako,” said De Luna, who dreams of becoming an aeronautics or communications engineer.(I was always interested in technology, even as a kid. I would make toys. I joined the robotics program in our school when it was launched.)A delegate from the Philippine Science High School got the most number of medals by a student in last year's WRG in Bandung, Indonesia, where the Philippines won 47 medals.“Kung sa preparation, prepared kami. Pero magagaling din kasi yung taga ibang bansa,” said De Luna's coach, Mervin Boco. (We are prepared, but the delegates from other countries are also good.)Twenty-one schools in the Philippines are joining the WRG, showing growing interest in robotics, said the Filipino team's sponsor, Data Science Corp vice president Josephine Legaspi.Even public high schools are launching robotics programs despite expensive equipment costs. Some students get creative, using tin cans and other recyclable materials for their robots, Legaspi said.Open source microcontrollers like Arduino, the brains of the robots, have also made robotics more accessible, she said.SharePorsche share price set at 82.5 euros for mega IPOSeptember 29, 2022Pinoy martial arts na arnis sumisikat sa The Netherlands September 29, 2022Hurricane Ian pounds Florida as monster Category 4 stormSeptember 29, 2022Presyo ng gulay mula sa mga binagyong lugar tumaasSeptember 29, 2022TINGNAN: Trak sumabit sa mga kable sa Katipunan Ave.September 29, 2022Apple removes Russian social network VK from app storeSeptember 29, 2022Tindahan ng medical supplies sa Maynila, nasunogSeptember 29, 2022James Bond's Aston Martin sells for nearly £3 millionSeptember 29, 2022“Ginto” exhibit, nagbukas sa IstanbulSeptember 29, 2022Maturity will be Cignal's advantage vs. Sta.
