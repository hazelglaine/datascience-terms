This is where the work of my team comes in, we work on ‘raise’ and ‘reduce’,” Moxley said.“Political news and events can be subject to misinformation, so the availability of authoritative information sources is crucial. Over the last few years, we’ve made deep investments to make YouTube a more reliable source for news, while also maintaining the openness of the platform," she added.Ahead of the elections, YouTube said the following features would help steer internet users towards credible content and vetted information:• Candidate information panel - it appears at the top of the search results when a user in the Philippines searches the name of a presidential or vice presidential candidate, providing information that is vetted from non-partisan, third party sources
• How to vote information panel - this appears when the user searches for the phrase "how to vote." The panel will link to the Commission on Elections website with relevant informationYouTube's other features that aim to boost credible information include:• A Top News and Breaking News shelf which appears on the homepage to highlight "quality journalism" 
• Information panel indicating funding sources (example: if a publisher is funded by the government or publicly funded)
• Information panel which gives context that links to third party sources for topics that are prone to misinformation such as Martial Law in the PhilippinesPROTECTING NEWS ORGANIZATIONS, JOURNALISTSMeanwhile, Google News Lab is also supporting fact check initiatives as well as journalists covering the elections, News Lab lead for APAC Irene Jay Liu said.The tech giant has invested in #FactFirstPH, Liu said.The initiative includes many different organizations including those from civil society, the business community, academe, research groups and others who each have a role to play to debunk myths, amplify vetted information, and identify trends to fight misinformation. Google also tapped the University of the Philippines to develop an election workshop series for journalists, with an installment happening on March 4 and 5.News organizations are also encouraged to apply under Project Shield, developed by Jigsaw and Google, which offers free protection from DDoS attacks.The program can defend journalists against phishing, block malware and prevent fraudulent access to data, Liu said."We know journalists are the target of online attacks because what you do is important in disseminating information during the election...This is a program that allows you to have the extra layer of security," she said. Other internet-based platforms including Facebook and Twitter have also ramped up their campaign against misinformation as more and more Filipinos turn to social media and the internet during the campaign season.Amor Maclang, a brand "architect" and co-founder of consultancy firm Geiser Maclang earlier said candidates now prefer to engage voters in platforms that are relevant to them, which explains why some aspirants ditch debates, which were previously among the few main venues for campaigns.Maclang said learning to use technology as well as big data could help political aspirants win the support of Filipino voters. RELATED VIDEO:ShareP29.6M halaga ng tulong naipamigay sa mga biktima ni Karding September 29, 2022The eye of Hurricane IanSeptember 29, 2022Badoy to SC: I did not threaten Judge MalagarSeptember 29, 2022Martial law documentary screened in CaliforniaSeptember 29, 2022Porsche share price set at 82.5 euros for mega IPOSeptember 29, 2022Pinoy martial arts na arnis sumisikat sa The Netherlands September 29, 2022Hurricane Ian pounds Florida as monster Category 4 stormSeptember 29, 2022Presyo ng gulay mula sa mga binagyong lugar tumaasSeptember 29, 2022TINGNAN: Trak sumabit sa mga kable sa Katipunan Ave.September 29, 2022Apple removes Russian social network VK from app storeSeptember 29, 2022Tindahan ng medical supplies sa Maynila, nasunogSeptember 29, 2022James Bond's Aston Martin sells for nearly £3 millionSeptember 29, 2022“Ginto” exhibit, nagbukas sa IstanbulSeptember 29, 2022Maturity will be Cignal's advantage vs. Sta.
